# Text-Translation
This project focuses on developing a multilingual translation tool that seamlessly integrates translation, evaluation, and pre-processing functionalities to improve communication across diverse languages. By utilizing advanced neural machine translation models, the tool aims to deliver accurate and contextually relevant translations.

Translation with M2M100:
The tool utilizes the M2M100 model, a state-of-the-art neural machine translation model that supports multiple languages for accurate and contextually appropriate translations.

Beam Search for Enhanced Quality:
To improve translation quality, the tool employs beam search, allowing users to customize the number of beams for more precise translations.

Pre-Processing with the Gemini API:
Input text is refined and enhanced through the Gemini API before translation to ensure better results.

Evaluation with BLEU and ROUGE:
The tool evaluates generated translations using BLEU and ROUGE scores, providing insights into translation quality by comparing outputs to a reference translation.
